<div><p>The checkbox decides if the game should treat a broken build with multiple authors differently. By default, all authors on a broken build get -10 points.</p>
    <p>If this checkbox is enabled, the game will treat a broken build with multiple authors as a build for which no scores are awarded.
        This prevents authors for being penalized unfairly and makes the amount of points an author will receive more predictable.</p>
